In this sample C# Console App I created a Task Management application that allows users to:<br />

=> Add a task.<br />
=> Delete a task.<br />
=> Mark a task as complete.

As a part of my BDD training I have also wrote feature files and step definitions for all the three features in TaskManager.Tests directory.

Through this project I learned:<br />

=> How Visual Studio works.<br />
=> How to write feature files<br />
=> How to write Step Definitions<br />
=> How to connect our tests to the actual application.<br />
=> The overall flow of BDD.
