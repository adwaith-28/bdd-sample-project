In this sample C# Console App I created a Task Management application that allows users to:
=> Add a task.
=> Delete a task.
=> Mark a task as complete.

As a part of my BDD training I have also wrote feature files and step definitions for all the three features in TaskManager.Tests directory.

Through this project I learned:

=> How Visual Studio works.
=> How to write feature files
=> How to write Step Definitions
=> How to connect our tests to the actual application.
=> The overall flow of BDD.
